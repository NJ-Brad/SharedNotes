## Connecting to Organizer (Part 1)
Add a referenct to the projects 
FormControlLib
PCData
Utilities

Add nuGet references
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting

View the form code

Add using FormControlLib at the top of the file
Add using PCData at the top of the file

using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

Change the base class from UserControl to FormControl

Add the following variables to the class
```csharp
IDbContextFactory<PCDataContext> _contextFactory = null;
private readonly IHost _host;
```

Replace
```csharp
public ClassName()
{
    InitializeComponent();
}
```

with
```csharp
public ClassName(IDbContextFactory<PCDataContext> contextFactory, IHost host)
{
    _contextFactory = contextFactory;

    InitializeComponent();
    _host = host;

}
```
Add a method for connecting the component to Dependency Injection
```csharp
public static void ConnectToServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<TaskControl>();
}
```
In the Organizer project, add a preoject reference to your new component project
In the Organizer project, open Program.cs
In the ConfigureServices lambda, add

```csharp
Namespace.Classname.ConnectToServices(services);
```
You should be able to see the new component on the left tree and see a blank component when you select it.

## Adding an icon and label
Add an icon (.ico) to your project
Set the Icon property of your new component to be the icon you just added

Edit the code for the new component
At the end of the constructor, add text to be displayed for your component.  It can be on multiple lines

```csharp
Text = "My\r\nNew\r\nComponent";
```
