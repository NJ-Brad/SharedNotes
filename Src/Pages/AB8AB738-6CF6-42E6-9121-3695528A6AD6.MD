Copy dialog to WizardPages folder
Rename top-level file (it will rename the rest)
DO NOT allow the automated refactoring to happen, if prompted
Start to rename the main file, and copy the name.  (pres esc to cancel the rename)
Right click the main file and select view code
Rename the class and the construtor (paste the name you just copied)
Expand the tree in the solution explorer
Open the .Designer.cs file corresponding to the new page
Replace the name of the class
Search for the this.Name = and change the name to the new one
Go back to the main file
Change the base class from Form to WizardPage
Comment out any reference to DialogResult or Close() - You will need to account for these in WizardPage ways, later
If you have an OnShown override, replace it with this

```csharp
        protected override void FirstShown()
        {
            base.FirstShown();
		// more code here
        }
```

Additional tweaks to designer file will be required
Remove
```csharp
this.AcceptButton
this.CancelButton
this.FormBorderStyle
this.MaximizeBox
this.MinimizeBox
```
Remove OK and Cancel buttons - leave methods in place.  I will show later how to handle their funtionallity
Temporarily make the form template much bigger (at least twice the original size)
Add a panel, big enough to hold all of the original controls
Select all of the original controls
Select cut
Paste them onto the panel you just created
Position the controls within the panel as you want them to appear
Set the panel position to the top left
Resize the panel so that it encloses all of the controls, without being much bigger
Resize the form so that it is just big enough to enclose the panel
If you want the controls to be centered on the wizard form,
set the anchor value for the paenl to NONE
If you need to make adjustments to the size of the form, you should set the anchor value of the panel to top-left, before resizing the form

Create a method to override BeforeNext page
```csharp

        public override void BeforeNextPage(WizardPageEventArgs args)
        {
            base.BeforeNextPage(args);
        }
```

Move the contents of your OK button handler to right after base.BeforeNextPage(args) shown above
Add any data that needs to be passed to subsequent steps

```csharp
            Data["ResultText"] = tableText;
```
