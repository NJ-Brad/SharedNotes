Update the model class with the new field
create the migration
```powershell
add-migration
```
Get the name of the migration
in your context class, add 

```csharp
       protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
       {

           List<string> pending = this.Database.GetPendingMigrations().ToList<string>();

// more stuff goes here

       }
```
For each property that was added to the model, include code similar to this

```csharp
           if (pending.First(p => p == "20240212212026_MigrationTest") != null)
           {
               modelBuilder.Entity<Page>().Ignore(c => c.MigrationTest);
           }
```
